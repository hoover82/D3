# D3
Repository of D3 visualization

Created 2020-02-16.

First visualization is Halloween Trick-or-Treaters grouped bar chart.
It still needs a color legend to be added and values on the bars.
Stretch goal is to incorporate a mouseover tooltip, too

Consists of four files:

* danStoberArrayFunctions.js - javascript library I wrote to handle pivoting and unpivoting of two-dimensional array datasets.
    Future functionality will incorporate google dataTables, too
    
Next three are specific to the Halloween bar chart. Currently, the data are embedded inside thejavascript file
* trick-or-treaters.html
* trick-or-treaters.js
* trick-or-treaters.css

------------------------------------------------------------------

Second visualization is example of four waffle charts.
There is no CSS file for this one -- the color scheme is embedded into the javascript file
* waffle.html
* waffle.js
